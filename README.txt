Open the file Drum_Machine.pd and follow the instructions in the User Interface. For better performance use headphones.

This is a sample-based drum machine including 16-step sequencer playback. Additionally, it offers control over individual gains and 'swing' for each instrument. 
To use new samples, copy the .wav files into the this folder and rename them as the preset ones.
